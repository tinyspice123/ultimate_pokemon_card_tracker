# Ultimate Pokémon Card Tracker

A static, multi-set Pokémon card collection tracker backed by published Google
Sheets. The home page lists configured sets and their completion; each set opens
the same reusable tracker with shareable filtering, ownership totals, prices,
owned/missing/spares exports, offline caching, local card images, and
marketplace search links. Display and sort preferences persist in the browser.

The site has no application bundling step. GitHub Pages receives `public/`
directly after CI replaces the service worker's cache-version placeholder with
the deploying commit's short SHA.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Node.js 24 for checks and browser tests
- Python 3.14 for maintenance scripts and their tests

Install the development dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run the site locally:

```bash
node tests/e2e/static-server.mjs public
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4173/>. The local server is deliberately small and
serves only `public/`, matching the files deployed by GitHub Pages.

Sora and Unbounded are self-hosted under `public/assets/fonts/`, including
their OFL license files, so typography works without Google Fonts or a network
connection.

## Tracker controls

- Search, group, and missing-only filters are encoded in the URL so a filtered
  checklist can be shared. Search edits replace the current history entry;
  discrete group/missing changes remain navigable with Back and Forward.
- Card/table view and sort selection persist locally between visits.
- Missing, owned, and spares (`Have > 1`) lists can be copied or downloaded as
  CSV. Exports respect the active search and group filters.
- Press `/` to focus search and `m` to toggle missing-only while keeping the
  shareable URL synchronized.

## Add or edit a set

Set configuration lives in [`public/sets.js`](public/sets.js). Add one entry to
the `SETS` object:

```js
"stellar-crown": {
  name: "Stellar Crown",
  code: "SV7",
  sheetGid: "123",
  tcgSet: "sv7",
  tcgdexSet: "sv07",
  subtitle: "English master set",
},
```

Rules:

- Use a unique, kebab-case key such as `stellar-crown`.
- Publish the spreadsheet as CSV and store only the tab's numeric `sheetGid`.
- Keep the shared publication URL in `SHEET_BASE_URL` and make sure each
  configured set uses a different `sheetGid`.
- `tcgSet` is the Pokémon TCG API set code; `tcgdexSet` is the TCGdex code.
- Optional fields include `logo`, `eyebrow`, `subtitle`, `imgTemplate`,
  `promoSet`, and `cardmarketSet`.

After editing the registry, run:

```bash
npm run test:site
python scripts/check_logos.py
```

The first command catches malformed configuration and missing site assets. The
second checks external logo fallbacks and therefore needs internet access.

## Prepare the Google Sheet

Import [`docs/template.csv`](docs/template.csv) into a new sheet tab and replace
the example rows. The tracker recognises these columns:

| Column | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Group | Section heading used by the group filter |
| Card | Displayed card name |
| Number | Collector number, for example `107/142` or `SVP 134` |
| Variant / Stamp | Finish, promo source, stamp, or other distinction |
| Source | Optional source or product note |
| Status | Optional checklist status |
| Price | Estimated value of one copy |
| Have | Owned quantity, `x`, or `TRUE` |
| Image URL | Optional exact image override |

Publish that tab with **File → Share → Publish to web**, select the tab and CSV,
then paste its generated URL into `public/sets.js`.

## Local logos and card images

The site first uses files committed under `public/assets/` and `public/img/`, so
important artwork remains stable even if an external API changes.

Download or refresh all configured set logos:

```bash
python scripts/download_assets.py
```

### Create a card-image manifest

Put the correct source URL in the sheet's **Image** column, refresh the backup,
then run the downloader with the set's `sets.js` key:

```bash
python scripts/backup_sheets.py
python scripts/download_images.py backups/stellar-crown.csv stellar-crown
```

The downloader reads every row with a Card and Image URL, downloads those files
to `public/img/<set-id>/`, and generates `manifest.txt` automatically in this
format:

```text
Card|Number|Variant / Stamp|filename.jpg
```

It replaces that set's current manifest with the successfully downloaded rows,
so commit the images and manifest together. Rows without an Image URL continue
using the configured card-image APIs.

If Card, Number, or Variant wording changes later, re-key the existing manifest
without downloading the images again:

```bash
python scripts/sync_manifest.py path/to/sheet.csv stellar-crown
```

Use `--check` to report drift without editing the manifest. Cosmetic case and
punctuation changes are already ignored by runtime lookup; the sync command
handles unambiguous wording changes and refuses uncertain matches.
The scheduled backup workflow runs synchronization automatically before
validating and committing refreshed backups. It deliberately does not download
new image files; generating and reviewing repository assets remains an explicit
step. At runtime, a sheet Image URL takes priority, followed by its local
manifest override and then the configured API fallbacks. Clear the sheet Image
cell after downloading if the committed local copy should take priority.

## Back up collection data

Run this manually to snapshot every configured sheet into `backups/`:

```bash
python scripts/backup_sheets.py
```

The scheduled backup workflow runs the same command weekly and commits only
when sheet data changed. It also synchronizes image manifests; when that changes
anything under `public/`, the workflow explicitly dispatches the normal test and
deployment pipeline so production never waits for an unrelated push.

Validate every configured backup and exact-variant image mapping offline with:

```bash
python scripts/validate_data.py
```

The validator rejects malformed sheet columns, missing collector numbers,
duplicate card variants, invalid quantities, stale manifest mappings, missing
image files, and orphaned local images.

## Tests

Run each test layer from the repository root:

```bash
npm run test:site
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:python
```

- `npm run test:site` runs ESLint, then `tests/site/` validates configuration,
  HTML, CSP, JavaScript syntax, workflow policy, and PWA precaching.
- `tests/unit/` exercises shared JavaScript and service-worker behavior.
- `tests/python/` tests the maintenance scripts without real network calls.
- `tests/e2e/` runs the tracker in desktop and mobile Chrome with deterministic
  mocked sheet data, plus a service-worker-enabled offline reload integration
  test.

JavaScript coverage is written to `coverage/`; Playwright failures are written
to `test-results/`. Both are generated and ignored by Git.

## CI and deployment

On pushes to `main` and pull requests, GitHub Actions runs:

1. Site checks and JavaScript unit coverage.
2. Python unit coverage.
3. Desktop and mobile Playwright tests.
4. SonarQube analysis and Quality Gate validation.
5. Injection of a commit-derived service-worker shell cache version, followed
   by a GitHub Pages upload of `public/` when checks pass on `main`.
6. Post-deployment smoke checks for the home page, tracker, manifest, and
   service worker.

The weekly **Production dependency canary** follows a live published-sheet
redirect, rejects HTML/error responses, and verifies that the final Google
delivery host remains in both CSP allowlists. This monitors shard changes even
when no deployment occurs.

### Maintenance mode

To replace the site temporarily with its maintenance page, open **Actions →
Toggle maintenance mode → Run workflow**, choose `enable`, and run it. Choose
`disable` to redeploy the current site from `public/`. A later successful normal
deployment also replaces maintenance mode with the live site.

For rollback, sheet restoration, outage and image-repair procedures, see the
[recovery runbook](docs/RECOVERY.md).

The workflow uses least-privilege job permissions. Pages deployment requires
`pages: write` and `id-token: write`; SonarQube authentication also uses an OIDC
token.

Root-level files are limited to project configuration and documentation. Runtime
files belong in `public/`; test fixtures belong with their test layer.

## Troubleshooting

**The page is blank locally** — serve `public/` with the command in Quick start.
Opening the HTML directly with a `file://` URL prevents normal fetch and service
worker behavior.

**A set does not appear** — run `npm run test:site` and check its entry in
`public/sets.js`. The key must be kebab-case and the sheet URL must end with a
published CSV output parameter.

**Sheet data does not load** — confirm the individual tab is published to the
web and that its URL contains `output=csv`. A normal edit/share URL is not a CSV
endpoint.
If the URL works directly, check the browser console for a CSP error on a
changed `doc-XX-YY-sheets.googleusercontent.com` shard and follow the
[recovery runbook](docs/RECOVERY.md).

**A local card image does not appear** — check that its file and manifest are in
`public/img/<set-id>/`. Manifest matching ignores cosmetic case and punctuation;
for substantive label changes, run `scripts/sync_manifest.py`. Clear the sheet's
Image URL if you want the local image to win.

**A logo is missing** — run `python scripts/download_assets.py`, then commit the
new file under `public/assets/logos/`.

**Changes look stale** — reload once while online. The service worker uses a
network-first strategy for pages and configuration, but an already-open tab can
still display its previously loaded version until refreshed.
